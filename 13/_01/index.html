            JavaScript has never had any official solution for distributing
            packages, and every web platform (Rails, Django etc) has their own idea
            of how to structure and package JavaScript. In the last few years NPM
            has started becoming the canonical way of distribution, with Webpack as
            the build system, but there's no way to load NPM packages in the browser
            without a server-side component.

            Scrimba is a platform for interactive coding screencast where you can
            run the code at any moment in time. Being able to use NPM packages has
            been a frequently requested feature, but it turns out to be surprisingly
            technically dificult to implement. In this article I will explain how
            we tackled the problem and the final solution we ended up with.
