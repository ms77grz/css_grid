    <h1>Marine Biology</h1>
    <h2>The Composition of Seawater</h2>
    <p>Almost anything can be found in seawater. This includes dissolved materials from Earth's crust as well as
        materials released from organisms. The most important components of seawater that influence life forms are
        salinity, temperature, dissolved gases (mostly oxygen and carbon dioxide), nutrients, and pH. These elements
        vary in their composition as well as in their influence on marine life.</p>
